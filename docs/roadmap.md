# Roadmap

The order is set by what is expensive to change later, then by what later work stands on. It
is not set by what looks good in a screenshot. Architectural decisions (layout, the
simulation split, coordinate precision, colour space, serialisation) come before the systems
that would otherwise bake in the wrong answer. "Done" means the gate covers it, with the
commit that did it in the history. Rows 1–8, the work that made the current renderer
trustworthy, are recorded in [history](history.md).

## Phases

| Phase | Work | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Plan.** Scope, architecture, roadmap, standards. | These documents are reviewed and agreed. |
| 1 | **Layout and scaffolding.** Done 2026-11-10. The module tree, `jettison_add_module`, the existing code moved into `core`/`app`/`render`/`animation` (the scene parked in `render`, see [architecture](architecture.md#parked-code)), a stub for every in-scope module, doctest and CTest, `Jettison::Engine` and the consumer check, EnTT at v4.0.0. | Met: the gate is green, every module has a passing suite (25 CTest tests), and `source/test/consumer` links `Jettison::Engine` through FetchContent. The install export waits on its dependencies ([build and gates](build-and-gates.md#consuming-the-engine)). |
| 2 | **Core.** Done 2026-11-10. Assertions, logging, Tracy, configuration, string IDs, math additions, deterministic RNG, clocks, platform paths. `core` is filled in (logging over spdlog, assertions reported through it, string IDs and hashing pinned to reference values, layered configuration), and so are `math` (bounds and intersection tests in float and double, splines, easing, PCG32, noise and tangents), `profile` (Tracy zones, frame marks and plots), `time` (the real and simulation clocks, the fixed-step accumulator, the calendar) and `platform` (XDG paths, the executable path, and the start-up CPU check, five phases early). Two pieces moved to the phase that has a place for them: GPU zones to phase 4, with the pass list, and the app shell's move to `Log.h` to the smoke test's move. | Met: the math and RNG suites pass, the RNG checked against PCG32's published output and its distributions and the noise against recorded values. |
| 3 | **Runtime architecture.** Scheduler and tick phases, the simulation/presentation split with a command queue, events, the FSM utility, reflection, serialisation, VFS mounts, the resource manager, the definition registry, input actions, the console. In progress: filled in are `reflect` (types, fields, enumerations and attributes over EnTT meta, with registration errors that hold in release builds), `serialise` (YAML and binary archives over it, each tested as a round trip and against data that does not fit) and `vfs` (ordered mounts, shadowing, enumeration, and whole-file writes to the user mount). | A headless simulation test steps a world from a command stream and round-trips it through a save. The smoke test still renders. |
| 4 | **Coordinates and render foundations.** Double-precision positions, camera-relative rendering, reversed-Z infinite projection, the celestial clock and on-rails orbits, VMA, linear/HDR colour pipeline, a pass list with compute passes beside graphics ones, the MSAA HDR target and its resolve, per-frame storage buffers, debug draw, cameras (orbit, chase, cockpit, map). | A station orbits a planet at real scale with no visible jitter at the station or at the planet. The smoke test checks validation output with VMA. |
| 5 | **Space rendering.** Clustered forward shading: cluster bounds and light assignment in compute, PBR with image-based lighting, the sun, point and spot lights with finite ranges, sun shadows, skybox, frustum and horizon culling, instancing, LOD, procedural geometry, KTX2 textures, the material system, tonemapping. | The sample scene is a lit, shadowed station over a planet, its floodlights and beacons point and spot lights assigned to clusters, drawn within a frame budget measured on lavapipe and on hardware. The lights-per-cluster debug view shows the assignment. |
| 6 | **Star systems and galaxy.** One scene per system, jump transitions, asynchronous loading, scene layers, the spatial index, the jump-lane graph. | A jump between two systems unloads one and loads the other while the galaxy-level simulation keeps ticking. |
| 7 | **Physics and flight.** Jolt in double precision, shapes, sensors (docking zones), contact events, ray queries and picking, interpolation of the piloted ship. | A piloted ship collides with a station, docks through a sensor, and is picked with the mouse. |
| 8 | **UI, audio and persistence.** RmlUi with data binding, fonts, miniaudio with buses and 3D sources, versioned save games with migration, settings and keybindings. | A market screen bound to simulation data; a save written by version N loads in N+1. |
| 9 | **AI.** Utility AI, behaviour trees, route-graph pathfinding, steering avoidance. | Automated traders choose trades, plot routes across systems and fly them without collisions. |
| 10 | **Presentation polish.** Atmosphere, planet shading (clouds, night side, rings), particles and the transparent pass lit through the clusters, bloom, generalised animation clips for mechanical rigs, material effects. | |
| 11 | **Scripting and shipping.** Wasm host and mod API, data pack layering finished, pack files with zstd, crash handling, colour grading, cinematics, localisation. | A data mod and a script mod load from the user mount, and a packed build runs. |

Phase 1 was the last step before large-scale work: every system now has a home, a namespace, a
target and a test, and phases 2–11 fill stubs in rather than invent structure.

## Stubs

Phase 1 wrote a stub for every module in the catalogue below; the modules under
`source/engine/` are the list. A stub is:

- the module's directory, `CMakeLists.txt` and its place in the dependency graph
- its public header(s), with the main types and functions declared and documented: what they
  are for, what owns what, and which phase fills them in
- an implementation that compiles, does nothing observable, and fails loudly where doing
  nothing would be wrong (`JETTISON_NOT_IMPLEMENTED()` from `core`)
- one doctest test that the module links and its stub behaves as documented

A stub does not invent behaviour the phase that fills it would have to undo. Where a stub holds
configuration it was constructed with (a fixed step, a seed, a mount list), that much is real and
tested; everything that would need an algorithm throws.

## System catalogue

In priority order. Each entry is the brief for its stub. *Library* is the chosen dependency.
*Stub* names what phase 1 declares.

### 1. Build, layout and packaging · phase 1

`jettison_add_module(<name> DEPENDS ...)` creates `jettison_<name>`, the `Jettison::<Name>`
alias, the include layout, the private `jettison_warnings` link and the tests directory.
It exports the CMake package for the game repository.
*Stub*: the helper, `Jettison::Engine`, `cmake/JettisonConfig.cmake.in`.

### 2. Testing · phase 1

doctest, one test executable per module, registered with CTest and run by `scripts/ci.sh`
before the smoke test. The existing `smoke_sequence_test` becomes a doctest case.
*Library*: doctest.

### 3. Core · phases 1–2 · `engine/core`

Assertions (`JETTISON_ASSERT` in debug, `JETTISON_VERIFY` always, `JETTISON_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`),
logging (severity, category, sinks: stderr, file, console), configuration (engine and user
settings, layered), hashed string IDs (`StringId`, compile-time hashing), typed handles with
generation counters, hashing utilities.
*Library*: spdlog, configured with `SPDLOG_USE_STD_FORMAT` as a compile definition on its target,
so the engine uses one formatting library (`std::format`, which C++20 checks at compile time)
rather than also carrying spdlog's bundled fmt. Engine code logs through `Log.h`, never through
spdlog directly, so categories and sinks stay the engine's.
*Stub*: `Assert.h`, `Log.h`, `Config.h`, `StringId.h`, `Handle.h`.
*Filled in* (phase 2): `Log.h` dispatches to spdlog's stderr and file sinks and to engine
callbacks (the console's, in phase 3), with the category per message; a failed assertion logs at
Fatal, flushes, and stops in an attached debugger before it aborts. `StringId` and `Hash.h` hash
with 64-bit FNV-1a, pinned by the published test vectors. `Config` reads and writes the user
layer as nested YAML, round-trip tested. The app shell does not call `InitLogging` yet, and the
renderer still writes to `std::cerr`: the smoke test reads that output line by line, so it moves
to `Log.h` together with the smoke test's patterns.

### 4. Math · phase 2 · `engine/math`

Over GLM: `Aabb`, `Obb`, `Ray`, `Plane`, `Sphere`, `Frustum`, intersection tests, Bezier and
Catmull-Rom splines, easing functions, `Random` (PCG32 with the engine's own distributions),
noise (FastNoiseLite), tangent generation (MikkTSpace), and the double-precision aliases the
simulation uses.
*Stub*: `Bounds.h`, `Intersect.h`, `Spline.h`, `Easing.h`, `Random.h`, `Noise.h`; `Tangents.h`
was added when it was filled in.
*Filled in* (phase 2): each bounding volume is a template with float and double aliases (`Aabb`,
`DAabb`), and the tests are compiled for both. `FrustumFromMatrix` reports a plane at infinity
as one every point is in front of, so reversed-Z with an infinite far plane needs no special
case in culling. `CatmullRom` is centripetal, so a rail through unevenly spaced points does not
overshoot them. `Random` is PCG32, pinned by the reference implementation's published output,
with its distributions and `Noise` pinned by recorded values. `GenerateTangents` returns a new
vertex list, because MikkTSpace splits vertices on UV seams. The module is `DETERMINISTIC`.

### 5. Profiling · phase 2 · `engine/profile`

Tracy zones, frame marks, GPU zones for Vulkan, plot values. It compiles to nothing when
`JETTISON_PROFILE=OFF`. The client version moves only with the profiler's, because the two must
speak the same protocol: v0.13.1, the version nixpkgs provides at the current devenv lock. Jolt's
profiler hooks (`JPH_USE_EXTERNAL_PROFILE`) feed Tracy once physics arrives.
*Library*: Tracy.
*Filled in* (phase 2): `Profile.h` expands `JETTISON_PROFILE_ZONE`, `_FUNCTION`, `_FRAME` and
`_PLOT` to Tracy's macros, and Tracy's own disabled macros make them nothing when
`JETTISON_PROFILE` is off. Tracy is fetched in every tree now and is a public dependency of
`profile`, so `TRACY_ENABLE` travels with its target. Integers plot as `int64_t`, which Tracy's
three overloads would otherwise make ambiguous. The app shell marks each frame and zones its tick.
GPU zones for Vulkan move to phase 4: a zone per declared pass is what the frame needs, and
today's renderer has one pass and no pass list to put them in.

### 6. Platform · phases 1–2 · `engine/platform`

User data, config and cache directories (XDG), executable path, high-resolution time source,
crash handler hook (filled in phase 11). Windowing stays GLFW, behind `render`'s window type.

A CPU check at start-up: a machine without AVX2 gets a message naming the requirement, not an
illegal-instruction crash. Once Jolt's flags reach the engine, the compiler may emit AVX2
anywhere, static initialisers included. The check therefore lives in a translation unit
compiled without those flags and runs before any engine code, and it lands no later than
phase 7, when Jolt is first linked into the engine.
*Filled in* (phase 2): `ResolvePaths` follows the XDG base directory specification (0.8) for data,
config, state (logs, console history) and cache, ignoring a variable that is empty or relative as
the specification says. It touches nothing on disk; a writer creates its directory. The
environment is injectable, so the tests do not depend on the machine's. `ExecutablePath` reads
`/proc/self/exe`. The high-resolution time source is `steady_clock`, which is `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
here, behind `Time::RealClock`.
The CPU check landed early: it is small, and its hazard was already understood. It is a guard in `.preinit_array`,
which the dynamic loader calls before any static initialiser: on a machine without AVX2, BMI1,
LZCNT, POPCNT or F16C it writes the missing list to stderr with `write(2)` and exits with
status 1. Its translation unit is compiled with `-mno-avx -mno-bmi -mno-lzcnt -mno-popcnt
-mno-f16c` after every other flag, so neither Jolt's `-mavx2` nor a developer's `-march=native`
reaches it, and the guard calls no inline function or template, whose linked copy could come from
an AVX2-compiled translation unit. `platform` links with `--require-defined=JettisonCpuGuard`,
so every executable that links it carries the guard or fails to link; the app shell depends on
`platform` for that reason. A build of the guard with AVX2 forced missing printed the message and
exited before a static initialiser ran.

### 7. Time · phase 2 · `engine/time`

`RealClock`, `SimClock` (pause, compression factor, fixed step, accumulator with a spiral-of-death
clamp), `Calendar` (simulation seconds to an in-game date).
*Stub*: `Clock.h`, `FixedStep.h`, `Calendar.h`.
*Filled in* (phase 2): `RealClock` ticks over `steady_clock`, clamped to a quarter of a second so
a breakpoint does not become a minute of animation, and takes an instant the caller already read,
so the frame loop reads the clock once. `SimClock` turns a frame's real seconds into simulation
seconds (zero while paused, scaled by compression) and counts steps. Compression runs more fixed
steps per frame, not longer ones, so the step stays the one physics and AI were tuned for; past
the accumulator's cap of eight steps a frame, simulated time falls behind the requested rate.
`FixedStepAccumulator` drops whole steps over the cap, keeps the fraction for interpolation, and
reports the time it dropped. `Calendar` takes a whole number of seconds per day, so a moment's
date is integer arithmetic after one floor: hours, minutes and seconds are SI, a day that is not a
whole number of hours ends with a short hour, moments before the epoch are dates before it, and
`Format` writes an ISO 8601 ordinal date. Months wait until a game needs them. The module is
`DETERMINISTIC`.

### 8. Reflection · phase 3 · `engine/reflect`

Registration helpers over EnTT `meta`: types, fields, enums, attributes (saved, editable,
moddable, console). Used by serialisation, the editor inspector, console variables and the
definition schema.
*Stub*: `Reflect.h`.
*Filled in* (phase 3): `RegisterType<T>(name)` and `RegisterEnum<E>(name)` return builders that
add fields (member object pointers) and enumerators, each with `Attribute` bits held in EnTT's
user traits, which leave 15 bits. EnTT keeps a name's pointer rather than a copy, so `Name` has a
consteval constructor: a name that would dangle does not compile. EnTT's duplicate checks are
assertions, absent in release, and a field registered twice silently replaces the first, so
`Reflect` checks itself and throws `RegistrationError` naming the clash: a type registered twice,
a name already taken, a field or enumerator name used twice in one type, and two names whose
32-bit hashes collide, tested with a published FNV-1a collision pair. `Resolve` and `FindField`
compare text as well as the hash for the same reason. `Fields(type, attributes)` lists fields in
registration order, which is the order an archive writes them in, and `EnumName` and `EnumValue`
let a file store an enumerator's name rather than its number. Bases are not reflected, because
components and definitions are plain structs. GLM vectors are not registered here: whether a
`vec3` is a sequence or a map in YAML is a format decision, and the existing scene format writes
sequences, so `serialise` owns it.

### 9. Serialisation · phase 3 · `engine/serialise`

Reflection-driven archives: YAML (authored content and the existing scene format) and binary
(saves). Every format is versioned, and a version mismatch runs migrations or fails with the
version named. Loaders and writers are written as one pair and tested as a round trip. Row 8 in
the [history](history.md) is the reason.
*Library*: yaml-cpp (already pinned).
*Stub*: `Archive.h`.
*Filled in* (phase 3): `YamlArchive` and `BinaryArchive` write a class registered with `reflect`,
its Saved fields in registration order, and read it back into a default-constructed value, so a
field the data leaves out keeps its default, a nested one the default its owner gave it. Fields
are bools, integers, floats, strings, GLM vectors (a flow sequence in YAML, as the scene format
writes them), registered enumerations (by name) and registered classes, and vectors of any of
these. A field the data names but the type does not save is refused rather than ignored, so a
misspelt key fails, and so does a file that tries to set runtime state. Numbers go through
`to_chars` and `from_chars`: the shortest text that reads back exactly, whole-scalar parses at the
field's own width, YAML's `.inf` and `.nan`, and 1.2's `true` and `false` only. A string another
YAML reader would take for a number or a bool is quoted. Errors name the field's path
(`Ship.holds[0].mass`) and the line. YAML puts `version` beside the root's fields, as the scene
file does; the binary layout is little-endian, with a table of the names the file uses, enumerators
included, and every field written with its name's index and its length, so fields are found by
name and a field whose type changed size is reported. Every prefix of a save is refused as a
`FormatError`, tested exhaustively. A version mismatch throws `FormatVersionError` until phase 8
brings migrations. The scene stays on its own loader until the scene archive (entities, optional
components, the mesh path relative to the file) moves onto these, with `ecs`.

### 10. Virtual file system · phase 3 · `engine/vfs`

Ordered mounts (base, DLC, mods, user), with path lookup through the mount stack and
enumeration across mounts. Read-only except the user mount. Pack files and compression come in
phase 11 behind the same interface.
*Stub*: `FileSystem.h`, `Mount.h`.
*Filled in* (phase 3): lookup walks the mounts from the last added, so a mod shadows the base path
by path. A virtual path is relative and forward-slashed, with no empty, `.` or `..` segment and no
backslash, colon or control character, so data cannot name a file outside a mount and a mod's
paths mean the same on any platform; every call throws `std::invalid_argument` for a path that
breaks the rules, rather than answering as if the file were absent. Mounts are checked as they are
added: unique names, read-only sources that exist, and at most one writable mount, which is last,
so a file written is the file read back. `Write` writes beside the target under a name no virtual
path can have (`:partial`) and renames it over, so a reader or a crash never sees half a save;
there is no fsync yet, which the save-game work in phase 8 decides. `Enumerate` is recursive,
sorted and deduplicated across mounts, and leaves out names no virtual path could reach. Mounts
are added at start-up; the reads are then safe from the I/O worker.

### 11. Resource manager · phase 3 · `engine/resource`

`ResourceHandle<T>` with a generation counter, asynchronous loading on the I/O worker, reference
counting, hot reload in development builds. Retires the "cache keyed on a model's address"
hazard the renderer works around today.

### 12. ECS, scheduler, events and FSM · phase 3 · `engine/ecs`

The tick phases (see [architecture](architecture.md#frame-and-tick-structure)), system
registration with declared reads and writes, ordering constraints, EnTT signals and dispatcher
for events, and a small `StateMachine<State, Event>` utility.
*Library*: EnTT, upgraded from v3.6.0 to the current release in phase 1.

### 13. Simulation · phase 3 · `engine/sim`

`SimWorld` (its own registry, fixed step, deterministic), `CommandQueue`, snapshots to
presentation, and the definition registry: typed, reflected definitions loaded from data and
overridable by mods. Determinism rules are in the
[coding standards](coding-standards.md#simulation-code).

### 14. Input · phase 3 · `engine/input`

Devices (keyboard, mouse, gamepad, joystick/HOTAS through GLFW), actions with
button/axis/vector types, contexts pushed and popped (flight, map, UI, console), rebinding saved
to user settings.

### 15. Console · phase 3 · `engine/ui/imgui`

ImGui console: log view, command registry, console variables bound through reflection, history
and completion. The existing F1 demo window becomes the dev tools menu.

### 16. Large-world coordinates and celestial · phase 4 · `engine/celestial`

System and local frames in double precision, the camera-relative conversion, `Orbit`
(Keplerian elements, on rails, evaluated at simulation time), planet rotation, and the system
description (bodies, stations, jump points) loaded from data.
*Stub*: `Frames.h`, `Orbit.h`, `StarSystem.h`.

### 17. Render foundations · phase 4 · `engine/render`

VMA in place of raw `vkAllocateMemory`. Linear colour, an sRGB swapchain and HDR targets.
Reversed-Z infinite projection. Dynamic rendering and a declared pass list. Debug draw. A
renderer interface the rest of the engine sees, with Vulkan types kept inside
`render/vulkan`. Fills `IRenderer.h`, an empty placeholder today.
*Library*: Vulkan Memory Allocator.

This phase lays the ground the clustered forward frame
([architecture](architecture.md#rendering-clustered-forward)) stands on, so phase 5 adds passes
rather than restructuring. Compute passes are nodes in the pass list like graphics passes, with
the barriers between them declared. The HDR colour target is multisampled and resolved before
post-processing. Storage buffers are allocated per frame in flight, for the light list and the
cluster data phase 5 writes.

#### Shaders · phases 4, 5 and 10

Today there is one vertex/fragment pair (`shader.vert`, `shader.frag`), loaded by name in
`Pipeline::CreateGraphicsPipeline`, and one graphics pipeline built from it. The engine needs a
set of them, so the pipeline stops being singular before the second shader arrives:

- **Phase 4** turns the one pipeline into pipelines keyed by shader and render state, created from
  the declared pass list. Shader programs are found by name through the asset tree (the VFS from
  phase 3), compiled by `jettison_compile_shaders`, which already takes a list. Shared GLSL
  (the frame UBO layout, the vertex inputs, colour-space helpers) moves into include files that
  every program uses, so the layout the C++ side asserts (`sizeof(FrameUBO)`) has one source.
  The first new programs are the debug-draw lines and a fullscreen pass for the HDR resolve.
- **Phase 5** adds the shaded set: the **metallic-roughness BRDF** (glTF's PBR model: GGX
  distribution, Smith geometry, Schlick Fresnel, image-based lighting from a prefiltered
  environment and a BRDF lookup table), an unlit/emissive program, the skybox, shadow depth for
  the sun cascades, and tonemapping. Two compute programs come with it: cluster bounds and light
  assignment. The cluster lookup and the BRDF are one shared include, and every lit program uses
  it, so a material never lights itself its own way. A material names its program and supplies
  its parameters and texture slots (entry 19), so adding a program is data plus GLSL, not a new
  code path.
- **Phase 10** adds atmosphere, planet surface, particle and glass programs on the same terms,
  lit through the same include.

Shader variants (skinned and static, alpha-masked and opaque) are compile-time defines on one
source, not copies of it. Hot reload of shaders arrives with the resource manager's hot reload.

### 18. Cameras · phase 4 · `engine/render`

Orbit (stations, planets), chase and cockpit (piloting), map (system and galaxy, logarithmic
zoom). Smoothing and transitions use the easing functions. The cinematic camera follows with
cinematics in phase 11.

### 19. Space rendering · phase 5 · `engine/render`

Clustered forward shading, as [architecture](architecture.md#rendering-clustered-forward)
describes. Point and spot lights have finite ranges with windowed inverse-square falloff, and
are assigned to a grid of view-space clusters by compute: 16 × 9 × 24 to start with, tuned by
measurement, and covering the cluster range. The directional sun is separate, in the frame
constants, with cascaded shadows. Whether an opaque depth prepass pays for itself is measured
here, not assumed. Also in this phase: PBR (glTF metallic-roughness) with image-based lighting
from per-system environment cubemaps, a starfield skybox, frustum and planet-horizon culling,
instancing, LOD selection and tonemapping. `LightComponent` gains a type, a range and spot cone
angles, and the frame UBO's single light is retired. Debug draw gets a lights-per-cluster heat
map. Materials are data: a shader, parameters and texture slots, with time-driven parameters for
effects.

### 20. Geometry and textures · phase 5 · `engine/render`

Procedural meshes (UV, ico and cube spheres, rings, cylinders, boxes), triplanar mapping, KTX2
loading with BasisU transcoding, mip generation for development textures.
The engine links `ktx_read` (transcode and upload) only: `ktx` and `ktx_read` compile the same
transcoder and zstd, and cannot both be in one executable. An offline texture tool that encodes
links `ktx` instead. Phase 5 moves to KTX-Software v5 if it is out of release candidate by then.
*Library*: KTX-Software (libktx); stb_image stays for development.

### 21. Scene management and spatial index · phase 6 · `engine/scene`, `engine/spatial`

A scene per star system, built from the system description and the simulation state. Layers
within it. Jump transitions with asynchronous loading behind a transition effect. The spatial
index over simulation entities, either a loose octree or a sorted grid per system, chosen by
measurement. The jump-lane graph lives in `celestial`; the queries over it live in `ai`.

### 22. Physics · phase 7 · `engine/physics`

Jolt in double precision. Rigid and static bodies; box, sphere, capsule, cylinder, convex hull
and mesh shapes; sensors; contact events to the simulation; ray and shape casts. It steps inside
the simulation's fixed step, and the presentation world interpolates. Jolt is built with
`CROSS_PLATFORM_DETERMINISTIC`, so Debug and Release builds step identically, and with RTTI and
exceptions on to match the engine. Its public instruction-set flags make x86-64 with AVX2 the
engine's CPU baseline from this phase on, as decided; the start-up CPU check (entry 6) that makes
it safe has been in place since phase 2.
*Library*: Jolt Physics.

### 23. UI · phase 8 · `engine/ui`

RmlUi rendered through the Vulkan backend, with documents and stylesheets loaded through the
VFS so mods can restyle. Data models bound to simulation snapshots, never to simulation state
directly. Fonts through FreeType, shared with ImGui.
*Library*: RmlUi, FreeType.

### 24. Audio · phase 8 · `engine/audio`

Buses (music, effects, UI, voice), 3D sources attached to presentation entities, streamed music,
and simulation events mapped to sounds.
*Library*: miniaudio.

### 25. Persistence · phase 8 · `engine/serialise`, `engine/sim`

Save games of the simulation world and the galaxy, with format version and engine version.
Migrations are a chain of functions from version N to N+1. Settings and keybindings are stored
apart from saves.

### 26. AI · phase 9 · `engine/ai`

Utility AI (considerations, response curves, scored actions), behaviour trees (data-defined,
ticked in the simulation step), A* over graphs (jump lanes, in-system waypoints), steering
(seek, arrive, obstacle avoidance, separation). Everything runs in the simulation and is
deterministic.

### 27. Animation · phases 1 and 10 · `engine/animation`

Phase 1 moved the glTF clip player and the rotation animation out of `Model` and `Scene` into
this module as `Rig`, `Components.h` and `Playback.h`, unchanged in behaviour. Phase 10
generalises it to keyframed TRS tracks on any node and adds clip events (for example, "clamp
closed" triggering a sound).

### 28. Presentation polish · phase 10 · `engine/render`

The atmosphere scattering shell, planet shading (clouds, night lights, rings), GPU particles
with a sorted transparent pass, bloom, glass on that transparent pass. The transparent pass is
forward-lit through the same clusters as the opaque one, which is one of the reasons the
renderer is clustered forward.

### 29. Scripting · phase 11 · `engine/script`

A Wasm host: module loading from mod mounts, fuel/time limits, a capability-scoped host API
generated from reflection, and calls into scripts from AI considerations and events.
*Library*: WAMR (WebAssembly Micro Runtime), to be confirmed against wasmtime when the phase
starts. WAMR 2.4.5 is fetched and proven to link and run a module on Linux, built from its
embedding script with the fast interpreter only.

### 30. Shipping · phase 11

Pack files, crash handling (a backtrace and the log tail, written on a fatal signal), the colour-grading LUT, the cinematic camera and sequencer, localisation string tables.

## Decided

Settled on 2026-11-10:

- **C++20.** The language standard stays where it is. `std::expected` and `std::print` are not
  available; see [coding standards](coding-standards.md#errors) for what is used instead.
- **Linux only**, on x86-64: Wayland for the desktop, X11 for the headless tests, one
  toolchain (Clang 21 from the devenv shell).
- **spdlog for logging** (catalogue entry 3).
- **Clustered forward rendering.** Lights are assigned to view-space clusters in compute, and
  every surface is shaded once in its own material program. There is no G-buffer. Phases 4, 5
  and 10 are planned around it (catalogue entries 17, 19 and 28), and
  [architecture](architecture.md#rendering-clustered-forward) has the frame and the rules it sets.
- **x86-64 with AVX2 is the minimum CPU**: Intel Haswell (2013) or AMD Excavator (2015) and
  later. Jolt adds its AVX2 instruction-set flags publicly, so they reach every target that links
  it, and the engine accepts that rather than building Jolt for an older instruction set
  (catalogue entries 6 and 22).

## Open decisions

To be settled when the phase that needs them begins:

- **Wasm runtime.** WAMR or wasmtime (phase 11).
- **Pack file compression** (phase 11). zstd is the natural choice, but libktx (phase 5)
  compiles its own zstd 1.5.5 with public `ZSTD_*` symbols, so a standalone zstd cannot be
  added to the same executable. The options, in order of preference: KTX-Software upstream
  accepts an external zstd, which removes the copy; the engine builds one zstd and patches
